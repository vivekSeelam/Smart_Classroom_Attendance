# Smart_Classroom_Attendance
A final year project by Vivek Seelam and Akhil
We implemented our face recognition system on the Raspberry pi which is more portable and requires less maintenance. 
The challenge faced for the used algorithm is that it requires high-resolution pictures of more than 30 images per each person 

Considering the amount of time that is wasted in taking the attendance and then to analyse it our solution saves an enormous amount of time in the long run of 
any academic institution. 

We present a Smart Attendance marking system Built using RaspberryPi and Pi camera loaded with a trained Machine Learning model for Face recognition based on FaceNet algorithm 
which can recognize multiple faces in any given image.
The model not being very large made it possible to deploy in RaspberryPi and the entire system being small made it deployable in a small space utilizing very low power


To run the Smart attendance run the pi_face_recognition.py file with python3
